		gvfs is a userspace virtual filesystem where mount runs as a
                separate processes which you talk to via D-Bus. It also
                contains a gio module that seamlessly adds gvfs support to
                all applications using the gio API. It also supports exposing
                the gvfs mounts to non-gio applications using fuse.
