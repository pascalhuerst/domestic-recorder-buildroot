         FFmpeg is a complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert
         and stream audio and video. So far the buildroot ffmpeg package
         only builds libavcodec and libavformat. Support for other libraries
         contained in FFmpeg as well as support for the ffmpeg, ffplay and
         ffserver binaries could be added.
