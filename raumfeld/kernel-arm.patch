+================
+HELPER FUNCTIONS
+================
+
+The slow-work facility provides a function by which it can be determined
+whether or not an item is queued for later execution:
+
+	bool queued = slow_work_is_queued(struct slow_work *work);
+
+If it returns false, then the item is not on the queue (it may be executing
+with a requeue pending).  This can be used to work out whether an item on which
+another depends is on the queue, thus allowing a dependent item to be queued
+after it.
+
+If the above shows an item on which another depends not to be queued, then the
+owner of the dependent item might need to wait.  However, to avoid locking up
+the threads unnecessarily be sleeping in them, it can make sense under some
+circumstances to return the work item to the queue, thus deferring it until
+some other items have had a chance to make use of the yielded thread.
+
+To yield a thread and defer an item, the work function should simply enqueue
+the work item again and return.  However, this doesn't work if there's nothing
+actually on the queue, as the thread just vacated will jump straight back into
+the item's work function, thus busy waiting on a CPU.
+
+Instead, the item should use the thread to wait for the dependency to go away,
+but rather than using schedule() or schedule_timeout() to sleep, it should use
+the following function:
+
+	bool requeue = slow_work_sleep_till_thread_needed(
+			struct slow_work *work,
+			signed long *_timeout);
+
+This will add a second wait and then sleep, such that it will be woken up if
+either something appears on the queue that could usefully make use of the
+thread - and behind which this item can be queued, or if the event the caller
+set up to wait for happens.  True will be returned if something else appeared
+on the queue and this work function should perhaps return, of false if
+something else woke it up.  The timeout is as for schedule_timeout().
+
+For example:
+
+	wq = bit_waitqueue(&my_flags, MY_BIT);
+	init_wait(&wait);
+	requeue = false;
+	do {
+		prepare_to_wait(wq, &wait, TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
+		if (!test_bit(MY_BIT, &my_flags))
+			break;
+		requeue = slow_work_sleep_till_thread_needed(&my_work,
+							     &timeout);
+	} while (timeout > 0 && !requeue);
+	finish_wait(wq, &wait);
+	if (!test_bit(MY_BIT, &my_flags)
+		goto do_my_thing;
+	if (requeue)

+ *
+ * This chip is a bit nasty because it is a write-only device. Thus, the driver
+ * uses shadow registers to keep track of its values. The main problem appears
+ * to be the initialization: When Linux boots up, we cannot know if the chip is
+ * in the default state or not, so we would have to pass such information in
+ * platform_data. As this adds a bit of complexity to the driver, this is left
+ * out for now until it is really needed.
+ *
+ * [A|S|M]DTV1 registers are currently not used, but [A|S|M]DTV2.
+ *
+ * If the driver is feature complete, it might be worth to check if one set of
+ * functions for V3-V7 is sufficient. For maximum flexibility during
+ * development, they are separated for now.

+Version 1.61
+------------
+Fix append problem to Samba servers (files opened with O_APPEND could
+have duplicated data). Fix oops in cifs_lookup. Workaround problem
+mounting to OS/400 Netserve. Fix oops in cifs_get_tcp_session.
+Disable use of server inode numbers when server only
+partially supports them (e.g. for one server querying inode numbers on
+FindFirst fails but QPathInfo queries works).
+
 Version 1.60
 -------------
 Fix memory leak in reconnect.  Fix oops in DFS mount error path.
