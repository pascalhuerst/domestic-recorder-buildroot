+What is hwpoison?
+
+Upcoming Intel CPUs have support for recovering from some memory errors
+(``MCA recovery''). This requires the OS to declare a page "poisoned",
+kill the processes associated with it and avoid using it in the future.
+
+This patchkit implements the necessary infrastructure in the VM.
+
+To quote the overview comment:
+
+ * High level machine check handler. Handles pages reported by the
+ * hardware as being corrupted usually due to a 2bit ECC memory or cache
+ * failure.
+ *
+ * This focusses on pages detected as corrupted in the background.
+ * When the current CPU tries to consume corruption the currently
+ * running process can just be killed directly instead. This implies
+ * that if the error cannot be handled for some reason it's safe to
+ * just ignore it because no corruption has been consumed yet. Instead
+ * when that happens another machine check will happen.
+ *
+ * Handles page cache pages in various states. The tricky part
+ * here is that we can access any page asynchronous to other VM
+ * users, because memory failures could happen anytime and anywhere,
+ * possibly violating some of their assumptions. This is why this code
+ * has to be extremely careful. Generally it tries to use normal locking
+ * rules, as in get the standard locks, even if that means the
+ * error handling takes potentially a long time.
+ *
+ * Some of the operations here are somewhat inefficient and have non
+ * linear algorithmic complexity, because the data structures have not
+ * been optimized for this case. This is in particular the case
+ * for the mapping from a vma to a process. Since this case is expected
+ * to be rare we hope we can get away with this.
+
+The code consists of a the high level handler in mm/memory-failure.c,
+a new page poison bit and various checks in the VM to handle poisoned
+pages.
+
+The main target right now is KVM guests, but it works for all kinds
+of applications. KVM support requires a recent qemu-kvm release.
+
+For the KVM use there was need for a new signal type so that
+KVM can inject the machine check into the guest with the proper
+address. This in theory allows other applications to handle
+memory failures too. The expection is that near all applications
+won't do that, but some very specialized ones might.
+
+---
+
+There are two (actually three) modi memory failure recovery can be in:
+
+vm.memory_failure_recovery sysctl set to zero:
+	All memory failures cause a panic. Do not attempt recovery.
+	(on x86 this can be also affected by the tolerant level of the
+	MCE subsystem)
+
+early kill
+	(can be controlled globally and per process)
+	Send SIGBUS to the application as soon as the error is detected
+	This allows applications who can process memory errors in a gentle
+	way (e.g. drop affected object)
+	This is the mode used by KVM qemu.
+
+late kill
+	Send SIGBUS when the application runs into the corrupted page.
+	This is best for memory error unaware applications and default
+	Note some pages are always handled as late kill.
+
+---
+
+User control:
+
+vm.memory_failure_recovery
+	See sysctl.txt
+
+vm.memory_failure_early_kill
+	Enable early kill mode globally
+
+PR_MCE_KILL
+	Set early/late kill mode/revert to system default
+	arg1: PR_MCE_KILL_CLEAR: Revert to system default
+	arg1: PR_MCE_KILL_SET: arg2 defines thread specific mode
+		PR_MCE_KILL_EARLY: Early kill
+		PR_MCE_KILL_LATE:  Late kill
+		PR_MCE_KILL_DEFAULT: Use system global default
+PR_MCE_KILL_GET
+	return current mode

+ * This chip is a bit nasty because it is a write-only device. Thus, the driver
+ * uses shadow registers to keep track of its values. The main problem appears
+ * to be the initialization: When Linux boots up, we cannot know if the chip is
+ * in the default state or not, so we would have to pass such information in
+ * platform_data. As this adds a bit of complexity to the driver, this is left
+ * out for now until it is really needed.
+ *
+ * [A|S|M]DTV1 registers are currently not used, but [A|S|M]DTV2.
+ *
+ * If the driver is feature complete, it might be worth to check if one set of
+ * functions for V3-V7 is sufficient. For maximum flexibility during
+ * development, they are separated for now.
